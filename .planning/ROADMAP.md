Build a comprehensive meal tracking SaaS from foundation to deployment. Starting with Next.js infrastructure and Supabase setup, we'll implement meal logging with AI-powered analysis, integrate Telegram bot functionality, create dashboard and analytics visualizations, add health app integration via Terra API, and polish with settings management and landing page before deploying to production on Vercel.
